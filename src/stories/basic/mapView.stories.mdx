# Grid

## Grid view of a map in the dashboard.

Use the grid view when you want to display essential information in a condensed square format.

You can rapidly see the title, owner, last modification, industries and location of the map.
In addition, you can have access to a menu by clicking on the 3 dots icon.
You will have access to the modification of the essential information, duplicate it, sharing or sending the map to the archive.
